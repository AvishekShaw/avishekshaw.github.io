We learn distributions by rote. That limits our capability to understand the intuitions behind it.

In this post, we will play around with the various components of a poisson distribution to understand it better. The poisson distribution is stated as:

$$
    P\{X=x\} = e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!}
$$ 
{% endkatexmm %}

        is rejected if it falls in the gray region and accepted otherwise. These accepted 
        samples are distributed according to $p(\mathbf{x})$. This is achieved by sampling 
        $z_i$ from $q(\mathbf{z})$, and then sampling uniformly from $[0, k q(z_i)]$. 
        Samples under the curve $p(z_i)$ are accepted.

The first thing to notice is that the poisson distribution is a discrete distribution. This means that it can only take integer values. The second thing to notice is that the poisson distribution is a probability mass function. This means that it is a function that gives the probability of a certain event happening. The third thing to notice is that the poisson distribution is a function of two variables. The first variable is the number of events that happen in a given time period. The second variable is the rate at which the events happen. The rate is usually denoted by $\lambda$.

# Innocent Convicts and your next Nuclear Disasters 

(Simeon may not have worked on horse kick deaths. He may have worked on no. of innocents being convicted per year)

How many soldiers would die next year due to horsekicks? This question intrigued Simeon Denis Poisson. (Do we include some short history/tidbit of Possion?).   He started out to predict the horsekick-deaths by making two important assumptions: Independent events ocurring at constant rate.  If a certain event occurs at a constant rate, p per unit time, then, the total events within an interval t is pt. However, this does not give us a picture of the actual distribution of events. How was this derived? The mean and median of the distribution is \lambda

The Poisson distribution is derived using the following assumptions:

1) The occurrence of events is random and independent of each other.
2) The average rate of occurrence of events is constant over time and space.
3) The probability of more than one event occurring at the same time or space is negligible.

Let X be a random variable that represents the number of events occurring in a fixed time interval or space. Let 位 be the average rate of occurrence of events per unit time or space. Then the probability of X taking the value k (i.e., k events occurring in the fixed interval) is given by:

P(X = k) = e^(-位) * (位^k) / k!

where e is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828, and k! represents the factorial of k.

The derivation of this formula involves using the principles of combinatorics and the binomial distribution. Specifically, if we consider dividing the time interval or space into very small sub-intervals or sub-spaces, the probability of an event occurring in each sub-interval or sub-space is 位/n, where n is the number of sub-intervals or sub-spaces.

If we let n go to infinity and assume that the probability of more than one event occurring in a sub-interval or sub-space is negligible, then we can use the Poisson limit of the binomial distribution to obtain the Poisson distribution formula.

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution, meaning that it gives the probability of a countable number of events occurring in a fixed interval or space. It is widely used in modeling various real-world phenomena, such as the number of customers arriving at a store, the number of defects in a manufacturing process, or the number of radioactive decays in a given time interval.

Q) What are the applications of Poisson distribution?
1) You can apply poisson distribution to "Large number of locally rare events"
2) To study the chances of nuclear disasters. How is this related to your next nuclear disaster you say? Well, imprecise Poisson modeling has (https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/61879)
3) How many goals in a football match?

Some more properties:
Sums of poisson RV variables are Poisson distributed. (Find a practical example for this). The converse is also true.
