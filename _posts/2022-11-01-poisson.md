We learn distributions by rote. That limits our capability to understand the intuitions behind it.

In this post, we will play around with the various components of a poisson distribution to understand it better. The poisson distribution is stated as:

{% katexmm %} 
$$
    P\{X=x\} = e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!}
$$ 
{% endkatexmm %}

        <span class='caption-label'>Figure 1.</span> Diagram of rejection sampling. The 
        density $q(\mathbf{z})$ must be always greater than $p(\mathbf{x})$. A new sample 
        is rejected if it falls in the gray region and accepted otherwise. These accepted 
        samples are distributed according to $p(\mathbf{x})$. This is achieved by sampling 
        $z_i$ from $q(\mathbf{z})$, and then sampling uniformly from $[0, k q(z_i)]$. 
        Samples under the curve $p(z_i)$ are accepted.

The first thing to notice is that the poisson distribution is a discrete distribution. This means that it can only take integer values. The second thing to notice is that the poisson distribution is a probability mass function. This means that it is a function that gives the probability of a certain event happening. The third thing to notice is that the poisson distribution is a function of two variables. The first variable is the number of events that happen in a given time period. The second variable is the rate at which the events happen. The rate is usually denoted by $\lambda$.
